# FHR Signal Generation using CTGGAN

## Introduction

This project revolves around the generation of Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) signals using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The objective of this project is to facilitate the synthetic generation of FHR signals which can potentially aid in a variety of clinical and research settings.

## Files

- `CTGGAN.py`: The main source code file containing the implementation of the GAN model for FHR signal generation.
